 WifiDeauthenticationAttacks
The focal point of this project is the Wi-Fi de-authentication attack and to find the vulnerabilities in the different Wi-Fi networks. This project will show the importance of having a strong and unbreakable password, which will protect our networks from exploitation. These WIFI networks
have different levels of security standards and different ways of exploiting them, wherein we try to create an attack surface for each of them.
